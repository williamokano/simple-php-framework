# Simple PHP Framework
Simple framework developed on an job interview.

Based on the MVC rules (model-view-controller) and added some lib for pagination.

## Contains
- Routes
- Controller
- Super simple model (actually, just a empty model class)
- A non-complex view

### missing
Almost everything. The router doesn't support the http request types (get, post, etc).

It redirect all requests to a controller / method and then execute.

#### Nothing here

##### Really, why you still reading this?
